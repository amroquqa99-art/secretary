# Connected Apps (Claude, ChatGPT)

**Status:** Complete
**Last Updated:** 2026-10-04
**Audience:** Operator

The Claude and ChatGPT apps can use LifeOS as a custom connector. Their servers reach the MCP HTTP transport through a small, separate Tailscale node, running in its own container, whose port 443 is public (Funnel). Each app is approved once, on a consent page that only the operator's own tailnet devices can open. A connected app gets the restricted "read + safe writes" tool tier, never the full catalog.

What the tier allows, the token rules and the residual risks are in [MCP OAuth](../specs/technical/mcp-oauth.md).

## How the pieces fit

| Address | Exposure | Paths | Serves |
|---|---|---|---|
| `https://<host>.<tailnet>.ts.net` | tailnet only | `/` | LifeOS itself; never public |
| `https://<host>.<tailnet>.ts.net:8443` | tailnet only | `/oauth/authorize` | The consent page |
| `https://<mcp-node>.<tailnet>.ts.net` | public (Funnel) | `/mcp`, `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`, `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`, `/oauth/register`, `/oauth/token`, `/oauth/revoke` | What the app's servers call |

Connector platforms connect out only on port 443, and Funnel exposure is port-wide. LifeOS's own 443 must stay private, so the public paths live on a second node with its own hostname. It runs in a Docker container (`tailscale/tailscale`), so its network namespace holds no host service: a tailnet device connecting to it reaches nothing but what it publishes. Its only way into LifeOS is the transport's public unix-socket listener (`LIFEOS_MCP_HTTP_UDS`), mounted read-only. That listener serves only the paths in the table above, and a request through it never counts as a loopback peer, so it can never reach the consent page or the connected-apps list.

The app's servers discover the authorization server on the public node, register themselves, and send your browser to the consent page. That page loads only on a device that is on your tailnet and signed in as an operator login. After approval the app talks only to the public node, with a short-lived access token that it refreshes on its own.

## Set up the host

The MCP HTTP transport must already run: `LIFEOS_MCP_BEARER_TOKEN` set and the `lifeos-mcp-http` unit enabled, as in [Agent Worker Setup](agent-worker-setup.md#step-3--enable-the-mcp-http-systemd-unit). Without the bearer token the transport does not start. Docker must be installed with your user in the `docker` group, and the tailnet must allow Funnel for your devices (the `funnel` node attribute in the Tailscale admin console).

1. Add to `.env`, with your hostnames and your Tailscale login (`tailscale status --json` shows it under `User`; list only your own — anyone listed can approve an app):

   ```bash
   LIFEOS_OAUTH_OPERATOR_LOGINS=operator@example.com
   LIFEOS_OAUTH_ISSUER_URL=https://lifeos-mcp.<tailnet>.ts.net
   LIFEOS_OAUTH_AUTHORIZE_URL=https://<host>.<tailnet>.ts.net:8443/oauth/authorize
   LIFEOS_MCP_HTTP_UDS=/home/<user>/.local/state/lifeos-mcp/mcp.sock
   LIFEOS_MCP_FUNNEL_NODE=true
   ```

2. Add the consent route to `config/tailscale-routes.local` (private, no `funnel=on`):

   ```
   https=8443 path=/oauth/authorize target=http://127.0.0.1:8765/oauth/authorize
   ```

3. Restart the transport so it opens the socket, then apply the routes:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart lifeos-mcp-http
   ./scripts/setup-tailscale.sh
   ```

4. Start the node and log it in once, as yourself. `login` prints a URL; open it and approve the node, then publish:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/mcp-funnel-node.sh up       # exits 3 until the node is logged in
   ./scripts/mcp-funnel-node.sh login
   ./scripts/mcp-funnel-node.sh apply
   ```

5. Check: `./scripts/mcp-funnel-node.sh check` exits 0, and `docker exec lifeos-mcp-funnel tailscale funnel status` shows `/` proxying to `unix:/sock/mcp.sock` under `Funnel on`.

The container restarts with Docker, and its login lives in `LIFEOS_MCP_FUNNEL_STATE_DIR`, so the node comes back by itself after a reboot; the infra watchdog repairs anything else. A newly published node can take several minutes before public connections succeed.

## Connect an app

The connector URL is `https://lifeos-mcp.<tailnet>.ts.net/mcp`.

- **Claude** (web, desktop or mobile): Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector. Paste the URL; leave the OAuth client fields empty.
- **ChatGPT** (on chatgpt.com): turn on Developer mode (Settings → Security and login, or Settings → Apps → Advanced settings). Then on the Plugins page, the **+** button → Create MCP App, with the URL as the connection. Add it to a conversation from the tools menu.

The app opens the consent page. Open it on a device that is on the tailnet and signed in as the operator login; it names the app, its redirect host and the tier. Approve. The connector then lists LifeOS's allowed tools.

Apps decide on their own when to call a tool, from the tool descriptions and the short server instructions LifeOS sends when an app connects. Saying "check LifeOS" in a message, or a line in the app's custom instructions, makes it reliable.

## See and revoke connected apps

```bash
~/.venvs/lifeos/bin/python scripts/mcp_oauth.py list
~/.venvs/lifeos/bin/python scripts/mcp_oauth.py revoke <client_id>
```

Revoking deletes the app's registration and tokens at once; to reconnect, the app registers again and is approved again. Removing the connector inside the app does not revoke anything on the LifeOS side.

## Turn it off

- **Close public access:** set `LIFEOS_MCP_FUNNEL_NODE=false`, then `docker rm -f lifeos-mcp-funnel`. The node goes offline, so nothing is public. Running `docker exec lifeos-mcp-funnel tailscale logout` first also removes it from the tailnet.
- **Disable OAuth entirely:** empty `LIFEOS_OAUTH_OPERATOR_LOGINS` and restart `lifeos-mcp-http`. Every OAuth endpoint then returns `404`, and issued tokens stop working.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause |
|---|---|
| The app says no server responds at the URL | The URL is not on port 443 of the public node, or the node is down; `./scripts/mcp-funnel-node.sh check` and `docker ps -a --filter name=lifeos-mcp-funnel` tell which. |
| A public request from the LifeOS host itself fails the TLS handshake | A machine cannot reach its own Funnel address. Test from a device off the tailnet. |
| Consent page returns `403` | The device is off the tailnet, signed in as another login, or reached the page through a public address. |
| The app says the server needs authentication but never shows the consent page | `LIFEOS_OAUTH_ISSUER_URL` or `LIFEOS_OAUTH_AUTHORIZE_URL` names the wrong host or port; check `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`. |
| Telegram alert: the public MCP node is logged out | Run `./scripts/mcp-funnel-node.sh login`, approve, then `apply`. `logs/infra-watchdog.log` shows each check. |
