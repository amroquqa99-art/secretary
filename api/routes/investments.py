"""Investments snapshot — the operator's Schwab pipeline, served from Syncthing.

The publisher's weekday refresh (nathan-linux ~/Code/investments, private
repo nbramia/investments) aggregates the Schwab accounts + Guideline 401(k) +
TSP and writes summary.json / portfolio.json into ~/Code/Sync/investments;
Syncthing carries them to the LifeOS host. These endpoints serve the files
from disk — stale-but-present when a refresh is missed (check synced_at).

- GET /api/investments/summary            compact household picture
- GET /api/investments/portfolio          full detail (no price series)
- GET /api/investments/portfolio?section= one top-level section only
- GET /api/investments/movers?threshold=  scheduler digest: the investments
                                          repo's movers.py (big day movers)
- GET /api/investments/today              scheduler digest: the investments
                                          repo's day_digest.py (day so far vs IVV)

The two digests run scripts in the investments checkout
(settings.investments_dir), which computes them from live Schwab data; LifeOS
only runs and schedules them.
