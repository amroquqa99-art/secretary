# LifeOS Infra Watchdog
# Runs every 5 minutes (user unit lifeos-infra-watchdog.timer) and checks the
# host dependencies other devices rely on:
#   - Declared tailnet routes (LifeOS's own plus config/tailscale-routes.local):
#     re-applies any that are missing, alerts if one is still missing.
#   - LIFEOS_PEBBLE_HEALTH_URL (unset = skipped): alerts after 3 consecutive
#     failed health checks.
#   - LIFEOS_EXPECT_OBSIDIAN_SYNC=true: relaunches Obsidian in the user session
#     when it is not running, and alerts if it is still absent on the next run.
#
# Alerts go to Telegram with a per-kind cooldown. Handled failures exit 0 so
# the timer never crash-loops.
